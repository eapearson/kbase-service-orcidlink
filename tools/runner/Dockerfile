# Temporary fix for broken Python venv.
# setuptools is not used by poetry (see the install command below), but it is present
# anyway in poetry's venv (which is separate from that for the service). However, a bug
# in Python 3.11.1 (and perhaps others, I just confirmed with this version) installs the
# wrong version of setup tools -- it installs 65.5.0 from 3.11, which has a CVE issued
# against it. Just upgrading to the latest version, to avoid having to fix this when poetry's
# venv has a more recent version than 65.5.1 (which fixes the CVE). When the upstream issue is fixed,
# this line can be removed.
RUN cd /root/.local/share/pypoetry && source venv/bin/activate

# Don't need curl any more.
#RUN apt-get purge -y curl && apt-get autoremove -y

# Annoyingly it puts it here.
